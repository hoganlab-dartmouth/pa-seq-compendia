# pa-seq-compendia

To build compendia of publicly available RNAseq data for *P. aeruginosa*, sepcifically.

This short pipeline (collection of bash scripts) is written to download *P. aeruginosa*
RNAseq data from the NBCI SRA database and process them with salmon. It works off-of
a pre-downloaded SRA run table and pre-determined salmon parameters.

Before using the PBS script, the headers will need to be altered to run through a specific user
account on Dartmouth's disocvery cluster and/or dirs in bash scripts will need to be
restructured. 

## Installation

If these scripts are run locally they require the SRAtoolkit and salmon.

All software necesary has been installed on dscovery by admin.

## Usage

1. Upload a run table from sra to the working dir.

eg. scp

2. Assemble a directory structure.

3. Create a *P. aeruginosa* transcriptome index.

4. Process samples in the dir against the transcriptome index.

## Roadmap

This is a proof-of-principle project that could help set the stage for
a versatile, scaleable pipeline.
